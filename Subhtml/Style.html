                           <h5><p>Toprock is a major element of b-boying and b-girling (breakdance). It generally refers to foot movement performed from a standing position, relying upon a mixture of coordination, flexibility, rhythm, and most importantly, style. It is usually the first and foremost opening display of style, and it serves as a warm-up for transitions into the more acrobatic maneuvers of downrock.

Breakers may devote considerable time to developing their toprock, and the style they display is a point of pride.

Toprocking is a style of dance in and of itself, and the Indian step is the most commonly performed toprock "move". However, toprocking is very open to modification for individual style. For this reason, it has come to incorporate elements of salsa, Lindy Hop, Liquid dancing and the Robot. In particular, uprock, often confused with "toprock," is a competitively-oriented type of dance consisting of foot shuffles, spins, turns, and creative movements that may mimic combat.</p></h5>

                           <h5><p>In breakdance, moves performed on one's hands and feet may be referred to as downrock or (especially in the southern United States) as footwork. Typical moves in this type of dance include the "6-step", "2-step", "3-step", "5-step", "coffee grinders", "Valdez", "C-C's", and "front C-C's". Additionally in breakdancing there exists moves specifically known as footwork which place emphasis on one's foot movement. Examples of such moves include the Indian step, Salsa step, and Crossovers.</p></h5>

                           <h5><p>A freeze is a b-boying technique that involves halting all body motion, often in an interesting or balance-intensive position. It is implied that the position is hit and held from motion as if freezing in motion, or into ice. Freezes often incorporate various twists and distortions of the body into stylish and often difficult positions.

Spins are often combined with freezes, and the spins are usually done in the form of kicks. Various handstands ("inverts", "Nikes", and "pikes") can be frozen, and skilled breakers sometimes incorporate the technique of threading into handstands by forming a loop with one arm and leg, then "threading" the other leg in and out of the loop.</p></h5>

                           <h5><p>Power moves are moves loosely defined as relying on speed, momentum, and acrobatic elements for performance. They are prominent in B-boying, often the centerpieces of routines featuring the other elements (toprock, downrock, and freezes) that make up breaking. Also, power moves are closer to gymnastics than dancing. B-boys who focus heavily on power moves and execute them as a main part of their routines are often called "power heads". </p></h5>
