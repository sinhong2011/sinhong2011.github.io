                <div class="undermusic"><p>The B- Boy's genre is wide-ranging, as long as the rhythm is obvious and the sensation is pleasing.

<br>
Or a great song that listened to make you full of explosive power, or listened to a Beat that made you want to dance to a rock-and-roll battle.
<br>
<br>
These types of music are all B-Boy's choices. Some songs are full of feelings in the whole capital.

<br>
However, some people only have feelings in the interludes. During that period, we called it "Break."

When former blacks danced in ballrooms, the entire song rushed up and hopped when it was put on the part of Break.


Then there was a DJ who suddenly wanted to buy two similar vinyl records to repeat Break to let guests jump into fun.


Good Break usually comes from vinyl records in the 70s.


The old and old vinyl are expensive and difficult to buy.


So many of the rare Breakers of the 70s have its value!


Floor music has several popular B-Boy national anthems.


Eg "Incibleible Bongo Band - Apache" "Babe Ruth - The Mexican"
 
<br>
"Jimmy Castor Bunch - It's Just Begun" and so on


These songs can be said to never be tired of listening at any time.


But the music that B-Boy listens to may have more popular genres in some periods. I have been in touch since my earliest days.


Breakdance, at the time, listened to Old School songs like Electric Funk or Old School Rap.


Otherwise, they are more serious Big Beat. With the gradual development of information,


In some international competitions, the DJ's songs are the goals of B-Boy's pursuit of music.



DJ Woodo's early genre is very wide, but it tends to be a 70's movie and TV soundtrack and 70's Funk genre.


The DJ Ben (Billy Brown) early machine is to put 70's Disco genre. Come again


It was influenced by the United States to shoot God Machine, in IBE 2004 & 2005,


Get Hip Hop rap music right.


After a lot of DJ's genre tends to rock and roll, Funk


Rock;Latin Rock;Jazz Rock and so on. Until recently, New Funk music has been gradually increasing.


This makes B-Boys have more new songs to listen to!


Here are some of the songs that B-Boy often listens to


The wind was introduced separately


<br>
̇Africa Funk (African Funk) -


In Funk music in Africa, the biggest feature of African music is the musical instruments of local tribes in Africa.


With the inherent rhythm of blacks,


Make a variety of instruments play a rich rhythm beat. For example "Buari - Karam Bani".


<br>
̇Bollywood (Borlay House) -


The soundtrack used by the Indian film, the Indian Bollywood House is like the Hollywood House in the United States, and it highlights the characteristics of local musical instruments like African music.


Indian wind instruments sound very aggressive. For example "Kalyanji Anandji - Pyar Zindagi Hai", but this type of music is rare.


<br>
̇Breakbeat (crushed) -


The genres such as Breakbeat and BigBeat were developed in the later period. Some DJs will make electronic cymbals with strong beats.


Take some old songs again to sample and remix. The Battle of the Year will be a CD each year, and the genre inside is mostly such genre.


For example, the song "Def Cut - Come On" used at least ten old 60's~70's songs.



<br>
̇Disco -


Originated in the mid-1970s, extended from Funk music but faster than Funk. At the time, the music in the ballroom was all of the Disco music type.


So it also extends the dance of Disco. Saturday Night Fever & Thank God It's Friday (Fanaday Friday night)


Both films will promote Disco's dance & music. 70's Disco music often has some pretty good Breaks,


<br>
Eg "Silver Convention - Love In A Sleeper" ̇



<br>
̇Easy Listening (Light Music) -


That is, the non-serious classical music is played faster than classical music, and the genre is more relaxed and entertaining.


But it doesn't sound too strong. Playing music often plays some popular or classic songs at that time.


The familiar songs are reinterpreted in the way they are played.

<br>
For example, James Last played the song "James Last - Staying Alive" by Bee Gees.



<br>
̇Electric -


Electric Funk, the predecessor of electronic music, originated in the 1980s, such as "Cybotron - Clear".


The early stage of the breakdance dance was also about the 80's, when a break dancing theme film called "Beat Street" was used.


Many of the soundtracks used in the movie are the most popular genre of electric dance in that era. So why do we hear 80's songs now? It feels like Old School is.


The electronic music in the latter stage was very wide, and some of the Beats that had been added were also the genres that B-Boys often listened to.

<br>
German famous Breakdance group "Flying Steps",



In 1998, he collaborated with "Music Instructor" to perform an electronic dance "Music Instructor feat. Flying Steps - Super Sonic".



After that, there were some singles and CDs.



<br>
̇Funk (funk music) -
Originated in the late 600s and extended by black soul music.


Soul evolved into Funk and Disco was an extension of Funk. Compared to the soul music Funk, he used a heavier Bass ratio.


It sounds more dynamic and rhythmic, such as "Rufus Thomas - Itch and Scratch". 70's Funk music is the genre that jumps and locks most often.


For example "Sun - Sun Is Here". But by the 80's, Funk's music tempo became relatively heavy and fixed. Some of them also added some electronic elements.


80's Funk has also become the most popular genre for jumping Poping, such as "Zapp & Roger - More Bounce".


The spiritual godfather James Brown will invent some innovative and unique dance steps and dance with the Funk music he sings during the concert.


By the end of about 90 years,


Some music companies started to introduce some New Funk genres slowly, and many orchestras played some Funk genres by singing.


It sounds like a 70's Funk, such as "Fusik - Cypher Black".



<br>
̇ Hip Hop (Hip Hop) -


The earliest hip-hop rap songs originated in the 80's. The raps at that time were almost always Funk's style plus rap.


For example " Harlem World Crew - Rappers Convention". Compared to Hip Hop music late in the later period, Beat is heavier.


It is also because of Hip Hop music's Beat is very heavy, so it is one of the favorite reasons for B-Boy, such as "A Tribe Called Quest - Scenerio".


Many of the hip-hop music's melody is sampled and remade from the old Funk Soul music.


For example, the song "Das Efx - They Want Efx" was sampled at "James Brown - Blind Man Can See It".


So although Funk Soul & Hip Hop is black music, Funk Soul can be said to be the ancestor of Hip Hop music.



<br>
̇Latin (Latin) -


Latin American local pop music, Latin America is a multi-ethnic group,



A diversified and mixed music formed by the fusion of a variety of music. The dynamic Latin music is led by Brazil and Cuba.



Because the lyrics are in Spanish or Portuguese, they can feel a significant difference from English songs, such as "Harvey Averne Barrio Band - Cucaraca Macara".



<br>
̇Jazz (jazz) -



Fusion and Groove are also a kind of jazz, and Fusion is based on Jazz and other elements.


For Jazz Rock, it is jazz that integrates rock music, and it also infuse wonderful jazz music with Power rock music.


For example "Lighthouse - One Fine Morning". And Groove is only a relatively strong jazz, such as "The Blackbyrds - The Blackbyrds Theme".


<br>
Rocky Rock -


Rock music can be said to be new music that is interwoven by jazz, blues, rural and western songs, etc.


Through the evolution of time, the rock music branch has more and more genres, such as "Head Automatica - Brooklyn Is Burning".


The rock and roll impressions are usually very noisy, because rock music is easy to make people feel noisy.


It is also because rock and roll has Power that makes rock music sound more aggressive. For the song "Vehicle",


You can compare the difference between "Groove version" and "Rock version"!



<br>
̇Soul (Soul) -


Soul is the predecessor of Funk music. It is characterized by the fact that black people use a large number of sounds to sing while singing. The voice is thick and high-pitched.


For example "Coke Escovedo - I Wouldn't Change A Thing". The R&B that is popular today is derived from the singing of soul music.


The chant of the church is also a kind of soul music. Funk uses the singing of the black soul music and the rhythm of more joyful rhythm.


It can also be said that Funk is equal to Soul, so Funk/Soul is usually connected together. At best, this is the first comparison of Funk or Soul.




̇Movie & TV Theme (Movie & TV Soundtrack) -


In fact, film and television soundtracks are not a kind of musical genre, because the soundtrack of movie and television is to match music with the storyline.


There are some chasing and fighting stories in movie and TV programs. There is a bit of rush or hurry in the music, such as "Janko Nilovic - Drug Song".


There are also scores that sound very tragic, such as "I Gres - Restless." Blaxploitation is an action movie taken by some black people.


In the black action movie, Funk's genre often makes music. Every time there are genres that are popular at the time, but good music is never affected by time.


The world's Break music is so many that Dig can't finish. Only Digging can continue to dig into some good Break.


I usually absorb some music knowledge, maybe I can also Dig


Some good Breaks, like I had Dig to a cool Cantonese song before.</p></div>
